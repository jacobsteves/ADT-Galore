# PriorityQueue
An ADT module like a regular queue, except each additional element has a given priority. Elements with a higher priority are served before elements with lower priority.

## SetUp
To start, copy this repo to any IDE running C. From there, use the information in the interface to set up your Priority Queue.

## Tests
Simply run the function in Test-PriQueue.c to test. This will test all endpoints.
